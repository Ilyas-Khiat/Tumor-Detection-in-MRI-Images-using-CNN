# Tumor-Detection-in-MRI-Images-using-CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow, which can be used for detecting tumors in MRI images. The model has been trained using a dataset of 4370 MRI images (2475 with tumors and 1895 without tumors) that can be accessed via the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y2X452rGgjiGwb7uTn9M4xelANWqFp4J

### Requirements
The model has been developed using Python 3.8 and TensorFlow 2.5.0. To run the Jupyter Notebook file, you will need to install the following packages:

- TensorFlow 2.5.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Usage
To use the model, please follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the Google Drive link provided above and extract it to a folder called data in the root directory of the project.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook cnn.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment.
3. Run the cells in the notebook in sequential order to train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate predictions for new MRI images.

### Model Architecture
The CNN model used for tumor detection in MRI images consists of several convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The architecture of the model is as follows:

- Input layer (with the shape of each MRI image as the input shape)
- rescaling layer
- Convolutional layer (16 filters with a kernel size of 3x3 and ReLU activation)
- Max pooling layer (with a pool size of 2x2)
- Convolutional layer (32 filters with a kernel size of 3x3 and ReLU activation)
- Max pooling layer (with a pool size of 2x2)
- Convolutional layer (64 filters with a kernel size of 3x3 and ReLU activation)
- Max pooling layer (with a pool size of 2x2)
- Dropout layer (with a rate of 0.)
- Flatten layer
- Fully connected layer (128 units with sigmoid activation)
- Output layer (with 1 unit and sigmoid activation)
- Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set, indicating that it is capable of accurately detecting tumors in MRI images.
